STEPS
1-  Check the iOS version is compatible with the Xcode version : Check ur phone software version >>
check d number before the dot e.g. 12.2, we take '12', minus 2 from 12, so we get 10... So check
your Xcode, and be sure your Xcode version number before the dot is atleast 10 and above >> Pick d
number after the dot on the software version on your phone, for our case it is '2', ensure your
Xcode version number after the dot is not less than '2' as well.. So if your iOS software version is
 '12.2', your Xcode version should be atleast '10.2'
