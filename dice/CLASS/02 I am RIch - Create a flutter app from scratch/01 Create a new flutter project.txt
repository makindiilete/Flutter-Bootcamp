- 1 Inside android studio > Click on 'New Flutter Project'
- 2 Give your project a name and select the location and also add description if the input is available and then click next.

order.. e.g. com.cashboxng but if you do not have a domain, you can use your name e.g. michaelzakindiilete.com.. Make sure it will be unique.

CREATING OUR I AM RICH APP
-1  Delete all the code inside the main.dart leaving what we have below

// ignore_for_file: prefer_const_constructors

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp());
}

// Inside the runApp(), we have a MaterialApp() widget which allows us to create an app that conform
 to material design.. It takes a 'home' argument which can be any widget..

 CODE FORMATTING
 * Whenever you are creating a widget that is a method e.g. Center(), Text(), always add a comma at
 the end for dart to properly format your code
