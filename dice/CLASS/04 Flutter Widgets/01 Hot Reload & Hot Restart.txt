So far we always rebuild our app to see changes but with flutter hot reload, changes are suppossed
to appear immediately but for hot reload and hot restart to work, our app needs to be inside either
a STATELESS or a STATEFUL WIDGET.

Hot reload only rebuilds the changes made.. All the data remains the same so you do not loose your
progress e.g. if you are dealing with a form..

Hot restart restarts the app so you loose the whole state.. but then it restarts faster than
rebuilding the app manually...

This concept works for both small and large app.. So size does not matter...
